            <h3>PENDANG, KEDAH</h3>
            <h4>A Historic District</h4>
            <p>
                The name 'Pendang' is said to be derived from the name 'Pendiat' which means a trench or hole dug specially to catch and tame elephants. The elephants that have been tamed are bathed in a historical well located near the Pendang District Police Station. According to history, this well is the original well and never dries up even in the long dry season. Baby elephants are kept in a village called Kubang Anak Gajah and dead elephants will be buried in a place called Kampung Gajah Mati.<br><br>At that time, Pendang was the largest and most famous elephant breeding place in the State of Kedah apart from Mukim Naga in Kubang Pasu District. Elephants became the main vehicle at that time, especially as a land vehicle to send 'tribute' (Golden Flowers) to the State of Siam. Pendang is a district in the State of Kedah Darul Aman which was gazetted on February 1, 1975 and bordered by the Kota Setar District in the North, the District Yan in the West, Padang Terap and Sik District in the East and Kuala Muda District in the south. The area of Pendang District is 62,929 hectares or 629.29 square kilometers and is divided into eight sub-districts namely Tobiar Subdistrict, Padang Pusing Subdistrict, Guar Kepayang Subdistrict, Padang Peliang Subdistrict, Rambai Subdistrict, Bukit Raya Subdistrict, Padang Kerbau Subdistrict and Air Puteh Subdistrict.
